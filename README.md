## Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe, Xs and Os is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

## :page_facing_up: About 


* It is an easy and simple game, you just need to click in one of the round spaces to start playing.
* Try to make a sequence of marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to win.

## :woman_technologist: Planning & Problem Solving

* I did start taking notes on what I needed to do and breaking it down into small steps.
* After that, I did planning my tasks to achieve the result that I was looking for.
* The game starts clicking in any of the empty grids, X or 0 is placed where is clicked and that grid becomes blocked.
* It takes turns and verifies for the winner or draw. After the result, the player can click on the button to play again.

## :nerd_face: Cool tech

* I'm using HTML, Javascript and CSS.

## Bugs to fix :hammer_and_wrench: :firecracker:

* If you click too fast or too many times in the external div it'll break. 

### :mending_heart: Lessons learnt

Planning is a important part of the process and it really did help me to know what I need to do.
I should have planning a better layout.

## Future features :star_struck: 

Improve the player experience and upgrade the layout to add some cool animation.
