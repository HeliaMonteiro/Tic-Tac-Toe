## Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe, Xs and Os is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

* It is a easy and simple game, you  just need to click in one off the round spaces to start play.
* Try to make a sequence of marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to win.

## ✏️ Planning & Problem Solving

* I did start taking notes what I need to do and breaking it down into small steps.
* After that I did planning my tasks to achieve the result that I was looking for.
* The game starts clicking in any of the empty grids, X or 0 is placed where is clicked and that grid become blocked. It take turns and verify for winner or draw. After the result the player can click in the button to play again.

### :mending_heart: Lessons learnt

Planning is a important part of the process and it really did help me to know what I need to do.
I should have planning a better layout.

## ✅ Future features :star_struck: 

Improve the player experience and upgrade the layout to add some cool animation.
