<!--Project 1 - TIC TAC TOE - GAME

Planning:

1. It has to have 9 clickable grids
2. I have to define 2 players = 0 and x
3. The game stars clicking in any of the 9 grids
4. After a grid be clicked it can't be clicked again (blocked)
5. It needs to alternate turns, the same player can't do consecutive click
6. The turns need to keep alternating until all 9 grid has been clicked or there is a winner.
7. Then I need to check if there 0 or x in a row
8. If there is display: the winner.
9. If not display: Draw.
10. restart game clicking in any grid again.
